# HypoMap3D - Single-Cell Integration Pipeline

Welcome to HypoMap3D, a comprehensive single-cell integration pipeline designed to facilitate large-scale integration and analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This pipeline was developed as part of the HypoMap3D project, presented in the accompanying academic paper.

## Overview

HypoMap3D enables the integration of diverse single-cell datasets into a unified, high-dimensional representation. It is designed to handle complex biological datasets, aligning cellular states across multiple experiments and conditions. The pipeline combines state-of-the-art computational techniques to provide scalable and robust integration, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization.


## Features

- Scalable Integration: Efficiently integrates datasets with millions of cells from different platforms.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Generates a reduced feature space for downstream analysis using principal component analysis (PCA), UMAP, or t-SNE.
- Clustering: Clusters cells into biologically relevant subpopulations using Louvain or Leiden algorithms.
- Visualization: Produces 3D visualizations of integrated single-cell datasets, facilitating exploration of high-dimensional data.
- Batch Effect Correction: Corrects for technical variability across datasets, ensuring accurate biological signal extraction.
